Description: Microsoft Translator API for Python
        -----------------------------------
        
        The *Microsoft* offers an online translation API to make requests
        through various forms (Http, Ajax, SOAP or OData.). The features
        provided by this API are very useful when we want to perform
        translations, multiple translations or even listen to the pronunciation
        of a certain word or phrase in desejada.Esta language library is an
        implementation in Python that allows to use most of the features present
        in this API. Basically what we do is, make a request to the Ajax API
        method by **requests** module and get the desired response. Below is a
        list of features offered by this library:
        
        -  Translation of one or multiple phrases and texts.
        -  Obtaining all possible translations for a word or multiple phrases.
        -  So speak, where you can hear the pronunciation of phrases or text in
           the desired language.
        -  This language detection on single or multiple sentences or texts.
        -  Obtaining all possible languages for translation and so speak.
